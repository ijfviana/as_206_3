note:
Computers are used by people, and people can become annoyed if their computers shut down or otherwise
behave strangely at unexpected times. Thus, you should know how to communicate such issues with the users of a
computer. Sometimes this task can be accomplished by setting login messages, but other times you must send
messages to users in real time.
